# 🚀 AI Code Editor

> Secure, seamless Code Editor powered by Express.js, LLM, and ShadCN UI.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

**Problem Statement 1 – Weave AI magic with Groq**

---

## 🎯 Objective

What problem does your project solve, and who does it serve?  
Briefly describe the real-world use case and the value it provides.

---

## 🧠 Team & Approach

### Team Name:  
`Quad Squad`

### Team Members:  
- Adityaraj Shrivastav  
- Anubhav Jha
- Archishman Debnath
- Mahargha Kundu

### 🛠️ Your Approach:

- **Why you chose this problem:**  
  We wanted to create a seamless and secure coding platform that not only allows real-time code editing but also integrates modern auto completion and fix bixes with LLM assistance — making it smarter and more user-friendly.

- **Key challenges you addressed:**  
  Handling CORS issues between frontend and backend, securing user passwords, integrating the Monaco Editor efficiently, and designing a clean, professional UI with ShadCN components.

- **Any pivots, brainstorms, or breakthroughs during hacking:**  
  Initially planned basic JWT authentication, but pivoted to integrating LLM for enhanced interaction. A major breakthrough was when we successfully combined the editor, authentication, and smart backend responses into one smooth workflow!

## 🧪 How to Run the Project

- The website is deployed on Github Pages.
- Click [here](https://anubhav0807.github.io/code-reviewer-client/) to access it.

### Local Setup (server side):
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/anubhav0807/code-reviwer-server

# Install dependencies
cd code-reviwer-server
npm install

# Start development server
node app.js
```

### Local Setup (client side):
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/anubhav0807/code-reviwer-client

# Start development server
python -m http.server
```

The project is splited into server and client side.
Server side is hosted on render and client side is hosted on Github Pages.
You can easily run the client side locally but on the server side we have use Gemini API key
and MongoDB Atlas API key as well which we won't be providing so you will need to generate
your own API keys and store them in a .env file.

## 🧬 Future Scope

List improvements, extensions, or follow-up features:

- Use Piston API to run the code in any language on the fly
- Add an authentication page and a security layer on user's code
- Tabs for multiple codes in the editor

## 🏁 Final Words

Building an AI Code Editor with **Express.js**, **LLM integration**, 
and **ShadCN UI** was an exciting challenge!  
Faced some CORS and integration hurdles, but learned a lot about full-stack architecture and smart UI design.  
Big shout-out to the organizers and open-source community — and to those late-night bug-fixing 
sessions that made it all unforgettable!
